Simple UserManual to use above chat system:
1)Read entire report once,all functinalities facilitated by this application are showed atleast once in screenshots inside report pdf
2)commands to execute the programs:
server: "gcc -pthread server.c" && "./a.out <portnumber>"  (portnumber can be port number in valid range which is not used curently by that OS)
client: "gcc -pthread client.c" && "./a.out <portnumber>"  (portnumber should be same as portnumber of server which is listening on it and should be in valid range) 
3)-pthread tag in command is required bcz we are using pthread library fns inside code.if no pthread related functions are used in the program then no need of this extra -pthread tag while compiling.
4)Both programs will give many warnings after compilation on one problem of using sprintf() fn inside code,ignore all warnings,only if there is an error then something is wrong.
5)can run both programs simultaneously in linux based systems(or even ubuntu wsl-both client and server in same wsl) if used correct commands as mentioned above,but might not work in windows based operating systems.
6)run both programs simultaneously in same host and same OS too--no need of any internet connection in this scenario-(otherwise both client and server cannot connect)
